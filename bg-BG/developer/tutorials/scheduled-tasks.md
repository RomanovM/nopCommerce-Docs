# Scheduled Tasks

With Scheduled tasks, you can schedule a task to run at certain periods. For example, nopCommerce sends queued emails periodically. The basic steps to create a new task are:

1. Define a class which implements **IScheduleTask** interface. It has only one method that takes no arguments; **Execute**. As you guessed this method is invoked when the task should be run.

2. To schedule a task the developer should insert a new **ScheduleTask** record into the appropriate database table. You can use **IScheduleTaskService** for inserting such a record.
