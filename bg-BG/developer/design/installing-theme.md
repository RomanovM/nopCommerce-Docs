# Installing / Applying theme in nopCommerce

Let's assume you just downloaded a new theme which is in a zip file.

1. Extract the contents of your zip file and copy it under "Themes" folder like shown in the figure below: ![extracting-theme](_static/installing-theme/extracting-theme.jpg)
2. Go to the admin section (`http://www.yourdomain.com/admin`)
3. Go to Configuration → Settings → General And Miscellaneous settings
4. Select new theme from the **Default Store Theme** and click **Save**.

Now, go to the public store. You should be able to see the new theme on your website.
