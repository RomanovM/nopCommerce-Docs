### By weight/Total

![by weight](_static/index/manual-shipping-by-weight-total.png)

The **shipping by weight and by total** option allows setting different shipping fees based on a shipment weight and total. The ability to charge different fees depending on the weight and total of the shipment helps to keep the company's shipping costs down when heavy items are shipped, yet offer reasonable shipping costs to customers who purchase light products.

Use formula **[additional fixed cost] + ([order total weight] - [lower weight limit]) &times; [rate per weight unit] + [order subtotal] &times; [charge percentage]** to calculate the fees, where:

* **additional fixed cost** - is the cost of shipment in case the weight is under a certain level (lower weight limit)
* **rate per weight unit** - is the cost of each weight unit above the lower weight limit
* **order subtotal and charge percentage** - are parameters for calculating the extra cost based on the order subtotal

For example, if you have the following shipping conditions:

* from weight 0 to 1kg and order subtotal from 1$ and order subtotal to 10$ the cost is 10$. You should create the **following shipping rules**: 
  * Order weight from: **0**
  * Order weight to: **1**
  * Order subtotal from: **1**
  * Order subtotal to: **10**
  * Additional fixed cost: **10**
  * Lower weight limit: **0**
  * Rate per weight unit: **0**
* from weight 1.1kg to 2kg and order subtotal from 11$ and order subtotal to 1000000$ the cost is 15$. You should create the **following shipping rules**: 
  * Order weight from: **1.000**
  * Order weight to: **2**
  * Order subtotal from: **11**
  * Order subtotal to: **1000000**
  * Additional fixed cost: **15**
  * Lower weight limit: **0**
  * Rate per weight unit: **0**
* over 2kg the cost is 3$ per each additional 0.5kg.You should create the **following shipping rules**: 
  * If your fixed cost is $15 and $6 per kg over 2kg.
  * Order weight from: **2.0001**
  * Order weight to: **99999**
  * Additional fixed cost: **15**
  * Lower weight limit: **2**
  * Rate per weight unit: **3** > [!NOTE] > it will charge proportionally for additional weight; > example for 2.1 kg it will charge $15 + (0.1 * 6)= $15.6

To add a new shipping rule, click **Add record**. The Add new record window is displayed:
