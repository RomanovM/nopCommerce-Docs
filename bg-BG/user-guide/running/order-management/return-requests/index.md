# Return Requests

Return Request feature enables customers to request a return on items previously purchased. This option is only available for completed orders. Return requests settings are managed in **Configuration → Settings → Order Settings on the Return Request settings tab**.

When this option is enabled, a **Return item(s)** button is displayed for completed orders on the order details page in the public store.

**To submit a return request**, a customer would need to take the following steps:

In the public store, go to the My Account window and click Orders, as follows: ![My Account Orders](_static/index/my-account-orders.png)
