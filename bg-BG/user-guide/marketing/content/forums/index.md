# Forums

A forum is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. Depending on the access level of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes visible. A forum may contain a number of subforums, with each having several topics.

> [!NOTE] in nopCommerce forums are disabled by default. To enable forums, go to Configuration → Settings → Forum Settings. Ensure that Forums enabled is checked. The Forums link should be displayed in the menu in the public store.
