# All campaigns

During customer registration, a customer can select the **Newsletters option** to receive nopCommerce newsletters. The other way of filling in email subscribers is to **export the list of subscribers** to an external CSV file as well **import list of subscribers from an external CSV** file into nopCommerce.

> [!TIP] **You can manage newsletter subscribers on Promotions → Newsletter subscribers.**

Use your subscribers list to create email campaigns to easily and quickly reach the target audience without any additional marketing activities. Campaigns help to promote trust and loyalty to a company while also increasing sales.

There are several examples of email marketing campaigns you can use for your store: start with a welcome email that thanks for the subscription, regularly send out announcements, news regarding your company, coupons for future purchasing and much more.

There **no campaigns available by default**, so you can create them from scratch in order to follow your own marketing strategy.

To manage campaigns go to **Promotions → Campaigns**
