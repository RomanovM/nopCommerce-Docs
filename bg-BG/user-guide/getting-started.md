# Getting started

If you are a novice in nopCommerce, follow the steps below to set your store up and running:

## 1. Configure your store

## 2. Create a catalog and add products

A catalog is what your customers constantly deal with. That is why it is crucial to make it easy to browse and find needed products.

### Create categories and manufacturers

Categories and manufacturers will be used in your catalog for product filtering. Learn how to deal with them and make the site navigation easier.

### Add products

You can add products manually one by one or import your catalog from an xml file.

### Define product variations

What if your products are variable, for example, you sell sneakers in different colors and sizes? In nopCommerce you can set up specification and product attributes to manage this.

## 3. Improve customer experience in your store

Now when your catalog is filled with products, ensure that your customers are able to get all the needed support on their journey to a purchase.

### Product reviews

Personal buying experience counts. It makes people trust you as a seller more. Learn how to make product reviews available for your online store and manage them here.
