  <h2>Introduction to the certification</h2>
  <p>The world of nopCommerce is expanding every day. More and more store owners are introduced to nopCommerce as more and more web developers start using it. For the mutual benefit of store owners and developers, we are happy to announce the nopCommerce developer certification test. This test is designed to verify developers’ proficiency in nopCommerce and their skills as nopCommerce developers, thus giving them official recognition and proof.</p>
  <h2>The certification in brief</h2>
  <p>Our certification is an online exam. To pass the exam, it is required to score 80% or more. Upon passing the exam, a developer is given the Specialist certificate and awarded the Certified Specialist badge.</p>
  <p>The exam fee is $100 and is non-refundable. To apply for the exam, a developer should buy an online exam voucher. The voucher can be used at any convenient time, so it is not necessary to buy it right before the exam. In case of failure to pass the exam, the developer is allowed to retake it for an additional fee anytime.</p>
  <h2>Benefits of the certification</h2>
