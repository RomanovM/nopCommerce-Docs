        <li><span class="arrow-left-title sprite-image">.</span><span class="page-content-text">Select the file for translating as shown on the picture below, for each version of nopCommerce, starting from 3.90, there is a separate folder. Every folder contains several files with language resources in English.</span></li>
        <li><span class="arrow-left-title sprite-image">.</span><span class="page-content-text">Duplicated resources repeat together with the existing translations from version to version. This is done in order to avoid excess work on the translation of the same lines. So, if you translate a line in the file language_pack.xml in <em>nopCommerce-3.90</em> folder, this translation will be duplicated for the folders <em>nopCommerce-4.00</em>, <em>nopCommerce-4.10</em>, etc. Therefore, it is advisable to translate from the older versions to the new ones.</span></li>
