# Plugins

Plugins are a set of components adding specific capabilities to a nopCommerce store. Examples of plugins include Payment modules, Shipping Rate Computation Methods and more. This section describes how to install plugins manually.

nopCommerce has a variety of plugins, expanding your store functions, on its [marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx). The plugins can be installed either by downloading from the marketplace or by accessing the storefront right from the admin panel.

The plugins on the marketplace can be sorted by category, version, name or rating, and are free or paid.

The plugins available on the marketplace are developed either by the nopCommerce team, solution partners or third party vendors.

> [!NOTE] plugins labelled “By nopCommerce team” are developed by the nopCommerce team and are distributed freely. Third-party services connectors are developed in the course of the Technology Partnership program, they are subject to nopCommerce [premium support services](http://www.nopcommerce.com/p/541/nopcommerce-premium-support-services.aspx) and are also distributed freely.
