# Setting up Tax

This chapter covers the settings of nopCommerce **tax tools**.

> [!NOTE] this chapter includes nopCommerce in-built tax instruments, not third-party tax services.

nopCommerce supports external services as well, but they require plugins from a [marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx) to be installed. The process of installation of such modules is described in the chapter [Plugins](xref:en-US/developer/plugins/index).
