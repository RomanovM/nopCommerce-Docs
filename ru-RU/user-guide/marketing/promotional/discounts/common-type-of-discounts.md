**Discount type** - here it’s Assigned to subtotal type when a discount is applied to the whole order amount before all the fees are added (like shipping fee and taxes). It’s relevant here because we want all the products in the cart to be discounted.

Besides Assigned to subtotal there several other discount types. There can be Assigned to order total - when a discount is applied to the whole order amount after all the fees are added (like shipping fee and taxes). Also, we can apply discounts to certain categories, manufacturers, or shipping.
