# Activity Log

Activity log is used to track user activity in the system. By default, all Activity Types are enabled for tracking in nopCommerce. A store owner can disable them by un-ticking the relevant checkbox. Most of the activity types listed are only for the administrator, and record actions in the Administration Area. However, some are for the public store and track actions of shoppers (such as, adding to cart/wishlist, placing an order, etc.).

**To enable/disable activity types**, go to **Customers → Activity Log**

Select tab: **Activity Types.**

Tick the **Is Enabled** checkbox beside the activity that you want to be enabled.

**To search for activity types**, go to **Customers → Activity Log**

Select tab: **Activity Log**.

Define the search criteria, using one or more of the following:

- To search by date range, in the **Created From** and **Created to fields**, enter the date range for your search. Alternatively, you can click on the dropdown calendar and select the required date ranges.
- **IP address**
- **Activity Log Type**

You can **clear the log of activities** at any time by clicking the Clear All button.
