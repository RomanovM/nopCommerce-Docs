# Tips and Tricks

1. One of the major issues in web development/designing is that different browsers use different default values for various CSS properties. While customizing or creating your own them – Always make sure that your styling is compatible with all the browsers. Test your website in major browsers like IE, Mozilla, Opera, Safari and Chrome.
2. While working with CSS style sheets, if you don't see any change on your website – Do not panic. Try deleting history and cookies of your browser and then try again by refreshing your page.
3. Make sure you understand the difference between id and classes. You can apply classes to multiple elements, while ids refer to only one element.
4. Make use of Firebug Add-on plug-in offered by Mozilla. It is a very useful tool which allows you to edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page. You can download it from here: [getfirebug.com](http://getfirebug.com/)
5. CSS style sheets do not allow you to start the name of your ids and classes with a number or other non-alphabetical character.
6. Do not limit yourself to span and div tags only. There are a lot of other / better features offers by CSS to style a page.
